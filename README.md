# flutterProject
Basically tried to create a clone of the samsung health app with a water intake counter, pedometer, mood notes and reminder. Additional features include video player and one tap emergency calling. 

Firebase auth has been fully implemented so only verified users can log in and no user can access any other user's data.
Firestore is used as the database to do crud operations on.
Local notifications package has been used to set reminders, and url launcher to make calls.
